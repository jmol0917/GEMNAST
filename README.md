# GEMNAST_pub
Computational high throughput platform for the assessment of nutritional and metabolic attributes of microorganisms/cells as represented in genome scale models 

The scripts in this repository are the scripts required to replicate the results from the paper titled "High throughput genome scale modelling predicts microbial vitamin 
requirements contribute to gut microbiome community structure" and include the corresponding reactions and dictionaries.

The scripts are ready to be ran once the correct directory inputs and outputs are specified. Further, download of the corresponding GSM models in SBML format from www.vmh.life is required and the directory where these files are located should be provided as an input.
